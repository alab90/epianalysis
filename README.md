# EPI Analysis

## Background
The 2022 Environmental Protection Index (EPI) offers a data-rich sustainability scorecard that translates scientific findings into policy insights. The EPI ranks 180 countries 11 issue categories on their national efforts to protect environmental health, enhance ecosystem vitality, and mitigate climate change. 


## Project Purpose
For the purpose of this analysis, we will compare country EPI scores against a country's GDP per capita, population, and Gini Index score. The Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of household income in an economy is equal where 0 represents perfect equality and 100 represents perfect inequality.

Key questions include:  
+_Which countries have the highest and lowest EPI scores?_  
+_How does a country's GDP per capita impact it's EPI score?_  
+_How does a country's gini score impact it's EPI score?_  
+_How does a country's population impact it's EPI score?_  
+_What are some of the policies or practices of the top performing countries that could potentially be applied by lower performing countries?_
